Hello World - the first repository!

Hi there! I'm Tonya. Pleased to meet you.
I love html and css, learning JavaScript now and anxious to get to Python soon. I'm also an author, a cat mom, a lover of classic rock and classic R&B, and I never turn down an offer for a frozen Margarita. Thanks for stopping by!

See ya around, Frenchie!
